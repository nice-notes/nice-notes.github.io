          <p>
            Nice Notes was created with a simple mission: to spread kindness and positivity in a world that sometimes
            feels overwhelming.
          </p>

          <p>
            We believe in the power of anonymous encouragement. When you write a note, you're sending positivity into
            the world without expectation of recognition or rewardâ€”just pure kindness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Similarly, when you read notes from others, you're receiving support from someone who expects nothing in
            return. There's something beautiful about this exchange of goodwill between strangers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're having a difficult day and need some encouragement, or you're feeling inspired and want to
            lift others up, Nice Notes is here to facilitate that connection.
          </p>

          <p className="font-medium">
            Remember: A few kind words can change someone's entire day. Your note might be exactly what someone needs to
            hear right now.
